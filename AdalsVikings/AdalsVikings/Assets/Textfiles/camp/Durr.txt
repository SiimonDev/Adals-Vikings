		To light the fire I need to take some from the druids in the forest but in order to do that I need to
	
	convince them to let me have some and my plan to do that is to dress up as their god and trick them 
	
	which might seem a bit contrived but the thing is that the druids are really lighting their fire for their 
	
	god so if I only pretend to be a bear-deer then they will totally let me take some fire.To light the fire I need to take some from the druids in the forest but in order to do that I need to
